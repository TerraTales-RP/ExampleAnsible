# ExampleAnsible
## TerraTales Ansible Playbook

### Overview
This repository handles all incoming and outgoing plugin changes for the Temp (Test) TerraTalesRP Server. All changes should be done via creating a fork, making your changes, and making a merge request.
Then it will be approved by an administrator and pushed onto the live server at the next restart. There will be further docs in the future.

### Limitations
You can add, modify, and remove plugin binaries (.jar) files freely, however you can only add and modify the contents of
plugin folders. Keep in mind, plugins not contained in this repository will be deleted on the server. However, any files
generated by the plugin will not appear here if they are contained in the folder, they need to be manually added by a
merge request. This is for the sake of server security.
