## TerraTales Ansible Playbook

### Overview
This is the TerraTales Ansible Playbook. We use this to manage incoming and outgoing plugin changes, and they are loaded automatically at server restart.

### Functionality
- Checks Important Tasks to ensure they are running, like NGINX and Wings (Pterodactyl Docker Containers)
- Notifies Discord on Task Completion
- Starts & Stops the Pterodactyl Server using their Artisan PHP "API"-esk thing
- Pulls all changes from the upstream Git repository
- Synchronizes Upstream Plugin Files
- Requires little configuration

### Limitations
- Plugin Binaries (.jar's) can be freely added, removed, or modified with no limitation.
- Plugin Configuration Files (Anything under /config/) can only be added or modified, removals won't be registered.
- Discord Logging currently doesn't output the output of each task, this will be changed eventually.
- Unable to see Pterodactyl server status, due to limitations with Artisan.
- Must be stored in a private git repository if the plugins contain important configuration values, such as database passwords. This'll be changed as well.

### Why?
Plugin Configurations can only be added and modified to prevent the deletion of any plugin-generated files, such as playerdata generated by EssentialsX for example.
